# MITRE ATT&CK

This section documents my understanding and usage of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Rather than memorizing techniques, the focus is on mapping observed behaviors and alerts to relevant ATT&CK tactics and techniques.  
MITRE ATT&CK is used as a common language to describe adversary behavior during investigations.

This mapping helps connect raw logs to attacker intent.
