# Detection Theory

This folder focuses on how security detections work and how SOC analysts reason about alerts.

It covers alert types, false positives, severity vs priority, and the triage process used in real SOC environments.  
The emphasis is on decision-making under uncertainty rather than tool-specific workflows.

Understanding detection theory is essential for reducing alert fatigue and identifying real threats.
