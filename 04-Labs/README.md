# Hands-on Labs

This folder contains hands-on blue team labs from various platforms.

Each lab is documented as an investigation exercise, focusing on what triggered an alert, what evidence was reviewed, and how conclusions were reached.  
The purpose is to translate theory into practical SOC experience.
