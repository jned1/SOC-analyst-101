# Security Tools

This folder contains notes on common SOC tools such as SIEMs, EDR platforms, and network analysis tools.

The goal is not to master every tool interface, but to understand how tools support detection, investigation, and response.  
Tool usage is always documented alongside investigation logic and evidence interpretation.
