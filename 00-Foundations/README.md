# Foundations

This section covers the fundamental concepts required for SOC analysis.

Topics include networking basics, operating system concepts, and log fundamentals for Windows and Linux.  
These foundations are critical because all security alerts and investigations are built on top of network traffic and system logs.

The objective is to understand how systems normally behave before attempting to detect malicious activity.
